The subtitle of this book is “The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy” and that alone was what convinced me to pick it up off the shelf and eventually buy it (yes, I actually bought this book in a “real” bookstore since Amazon has gone full circle and has physical bookstores now).

I was expecting something similar to Andrew Yang’s book, [_The War on Normal People_]({% post_url 2020-1-15-the-war-on-normal-people %}), and it is in a way, but much more detailed than I expected/wanted. This book starts with the railroad and steel monopolies in the early 1900’s and covers just about every case of political and government action regarding business regulation from then to now.

It was certainly interesting, but way more information that I was expecting, which led to a very slow read for me which took away the urge to pick it up each night. I even skimmed some chapters and will have to go back and read some again when I have more time for this sort of thing.

That being said, if you are more into history and the finer details of things like this, I’d recommend the book, because it is interesting. This book certainly isn’t for everyone and I didn’t find it enjoyable considering I struggled to pick it up most nights.
