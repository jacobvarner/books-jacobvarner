This has been the favorite book I read this month and I think it’s the most important read right now. I’ve been a fan of Yang since I started looking into him, but this book opened my eyes to a lot of the problems he sees in our country and does a great job of explaining his ideas (he’s so much more than just UBI).

I especially appreciated this book because Yang is certainly a big numbers guy like me, but the examples and explanations are still easy enough for anyone to read.

This would be one of the few first books I'd recommend people read and I also highly recommend reading it soon, as his ideas will only be more prevalent as we move into the future and are especially timely now as he runs for the Presidential nomination.
