This was my favorite book I read this month, but and one of my favorites for the year so far. Bell has a nice way of showing his voice in the writing which makes the book easy to read.

He talks about looking at things from different views in the Bible and more so at the bigger picture. He addresses a lot of key things like the environment and taking care of the poor instead of building empires and wealth, which I appreciated.

This is a good book to read to get another perspective on key “Bible stories” and Bell’s writing makes for a quick read. It’s fairly lighthearted, but makes you think about things occasionally.
