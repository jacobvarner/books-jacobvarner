This book really covers a lot of bases and seems like the combination of "business school at-a-glance" and more modern performance improvements. The book is written at a very high level and almost feels like the summary of a much longer, in-depth book, which makes for a very easy and quick read.

There is a little bit of a vibe of the "get rich quick" schemes, but I think that's more because it's written at such a high level and the author has found success with so many different ventures and he tries to cover all of them.

Some success strategies seem to be a little oversimplified, but that might just be because there isn't a ton of mention of the things that don't work or didn't work for the author.

I think if I was to try and explain this book most succinctly, it seems like a combination of [The 4-Hour Work Week]({% post_url 2020-9-6-the-4-hour-work-week %}) and [High Performance Habits]({% post_url 2020-2-9-high-performance-habits %}).
