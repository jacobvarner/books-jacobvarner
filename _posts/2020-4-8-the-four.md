This book offers a good look into the rise of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple and the influence and staying power that they've already achieved. Galloway does a nice job of covering why these companies are successful before going into the problems that they already pose and will pose to our society. 

I appreciated the balance of appreciation and acknowledgment for what these companies have already achieved while also making sure to point out that they and other companies can be too powerful if proper regulations are ignored.

As someone with an MBA, I enjoyed the talk of what dynamics make each company successful as well as the analysis of other companies that could reach the same level as these four. While some of the appreciation for business success might not be enjoyed equally by others, I think this book is still a good read for anyone. These four companies already have a massive influence on our society, so it's good for others to learn how they got there and what others could get there as well in the future.
