This book offers a nice scientific explanation of habits and how they are formed. The author provides several examples throughout the book that make things easy to read and understand.

My only issue with this book is that how the examples and chapters are interwoven makes the book a little bit hard to follow.

This is a book I'd recommend for anyone looking to build habits or just understand how they work in the human brain.
