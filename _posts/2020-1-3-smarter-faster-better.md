This is the second book by Duhigg that I’ve read in the past two years after reading and enjoying his other book, [_The Power of Habit_]({% post_url 2019-1-13-the-power-of-habit %}) last year.

This one was very similar in style with several real world examples in story form but stayed away from the scientific studies more than [_The Power of Habit_]({% post_url 2019-1-13-the-power-of-habit %}). Because of this, I didn’t like it quite as much, but it might make the book easier to enjoy for others.

Between the two, I’d recommend [_The Power of Habit_]({% post_url 2019-1-13-the-power-of-habit %}) first, but both are well worth reading.
