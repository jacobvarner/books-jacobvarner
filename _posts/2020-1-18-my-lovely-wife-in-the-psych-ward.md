After a recent health issue in our family, I was recommended this book by a nurse, and I’m so glad she recommended it. The book hit really close to home and brought up some bad memories, but also offered hope and a sense of not being alone.

The book is written from the perspective of a husband that has a wife that suffers with a mental illness and does a good job of explaining his vantage point. While this book certainly doesn’t explain what it’s like to have a mental illness, it does a good job of showing how they can affect people who are closest to those that due deal with mental illness.

I think this book does a good job of showing the unique challenges that can come with mental illness, but also shows how they can often be very normal. I wish more people would read this book, even if it can be hard when it hits close to home.
