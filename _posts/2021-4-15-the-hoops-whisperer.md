Like [*Moonwalking with Einstein*]({% post_url 2021-3-9-moonwalking-with-einstein %}), this was another "fun" and different read that goes outside of the normal type of book I usually read. Ravin's passion for basketball and strict Jewish upbringing leads to a very unique career path and a seemingly fantastic career for him.

The many stories of Ravin training the best basketball players in the world make this a pretty easy page-turner while I feel that I learned a thing or two about their personalities and his training methods along the way. Reading about him going from a career and job that he mainly had because of parental and societal pressure to a hobby and then a job that he truly loves was a great motivating factor and added perspective I hope to always keep in mind in my own career.

Towards the end, Ravin mentions some of the uglier sides of coaching, management, and the front offices of a few NBA teams and while it was a little hard to hear, it's not all that surprising and I would like to optimistically hope that some have changed as the league appears to be even more of a "players' league" now.

I'd love to read a more up-to-date version of this book with even more stories about his unique career in the further flourishing last few years of basketball and the NBA.
