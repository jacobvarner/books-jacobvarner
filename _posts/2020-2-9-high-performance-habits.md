Yes, another book on habits, and don’t expect it to be the last for me. This one was much more data-driven based on research that Burchard had done with a large group of “high performers.” With that data-driven approach, Burchard provides several specific actionable items to do in day-to-day scenarios that he believes “have been proven” to make people higher performers.

I appreciate the systematic approach to this book, but it’s aimed a little too specifically at corporate life for my personal taste at this point. If by all means you are an executive or someone that needs to improve performance and productivity in that context, I’d definitely recommend the book.

The stuff in here is probably beneficial to almost everyone in some respect, but I’d still recommend [_The Power of Habit_]({% post_url 2019-1-13-the-power-of-habit %}) as a start for anyone in general.
