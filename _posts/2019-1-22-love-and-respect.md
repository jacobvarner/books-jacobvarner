Overall, this book goes over topics that need to be addressed and offers good general advice for marriage. I'm not a fan of how many cliches are in the book and the assumptions that are made about men and women in a marriage.

The book appears to be aimed at couples that are struggling with some of the more basic issues in marriage and are probably things that should have been addressed before even being married.

I guess the whole concept of the book is sound, but I wouldn't recommend reading the entire thing because I feel like the important takeaways in this book could have easily been conveyed in a much shorter book or simply a blog post.
