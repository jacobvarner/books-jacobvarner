I was thrown off by the more modern cover art and did not realize that this book was the original text from 1937. There is bits and pieces of decent life advice and mindset, but the book is clearly pretty dated. This is technically the last book I read in 2020, but I barely made it halfway through. 

As I've leared a few times this year, bad books really throw off my interest in reading, sometimes for months at a time, so my goal for 2021 is to learn how to put a book down and be okay with not finishing it. Maybe I'll come back to them later, but I've got way too many good books on my list and already on my bookshelf that I'd rather spend my time reading.
