This book definitely isn’t for everyone, but as someone who really enjoys basketball and stats, this was a great read. I’d seen this referenced too many times while studying advanced analytics online that I had to read it. The book didn’t disappoint, but it’s pretty dense. This is a book that I’ll likely go back and reference more often, so it has good keeper value.

Unless you are really into basketball (mostly the NBA) or just _really_ like numbers, this book probably isn’t for you, but if you are, it’s a good read.
