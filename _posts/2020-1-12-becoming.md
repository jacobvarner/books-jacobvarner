My wife got this book last year and it wasn’t originally on my list to read early this year, but I’m glad I did. This book gives a nice background on the childhood and upbringing of Michelle plus a unique look inside the White House.

The book is separated into three distinct parts, Michelle’s childhood, her early career and early relationship with Barack, and then finally their life in the White House. The book is barely political, but touches on the feelings behind a few policies both Michelle and her husband were passionate about with a very human voice.

I really enjoyed this book, and while it is pretty long, I was so sucked into it that I read it over the course of a few days. I’d definitely recommend this to anyone.
